# Introduction

Welcome to the practical application sessions of the **Mannheim Master
in Management Analytics - Accounting Class 2023.** In the next days you
will see how to solve common business applications with R and Excel and
to dive deeper into some research related application.

The goal of those sessions is to give you a general overview of how
common workflows can be automated/streamlined.

All sessions are programmed in R and a basic understanding of
programming is needed. The code itself applies relatively advanced
methods, hence it is not assumed that you follow each single logical
step. Rather this part of the course is designed to give you a high
level understanding of what is possible using common open-source
languages such as R.

| Day   | Session   | Description                                    |
+:======+:==========+:===============================================+
| Day 1 | Session 1 | **Building an Excel Business Case**            |
|       |           |                                                |
|       |           | In this session we will start by building a    |
|       |           | simple business case in Excel. Specifically,   |
|       |           | we will evaluate a small business decision     |
|       |           | with common metrics such as Contribution       |
|       |           | Margins and Amortization Period.               |
+-------+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
|       | Session 2 | **Translating Excel into R**                   |
|       |           |                                                |
|       |           | In this session we will take the logic of the  |
|       |           | business case of Session 1 and translate it    |
|       |           | into R code. This session will help you to do  |
|       |           | the transition from Excel to R. The outcome of |
|       |           | this session will be a static Report.          |
+-------+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
|       | Session 3 | **Building an interactive Business Case in R** |
|       |           |                                                |
|       |           | In the last session of the day, we will ...    |
|       |           | the full power of R and build an interactive   |
|       |           | shiny application. This application will       |
|       |           | enable us to have a far deeper understanding   |
|       |           | of the business case than we could have with   |
|       |           | only the Excel Workbook or the static Report   |
|       |           | of Session 1 and Session 2.                    |
+-------+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
| Day 2 | Session 1 | **Getting Data from the Web: SEC's EDGAR**     |
|       |           |                                                |
|       |           | In this session we will learn how the use the  |
|       |           | Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and       |
|       |           | Retrieval system (EDGAR) API to download US    |
|       |           | Financial Reports.                             |
+-------+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
|       | Session 2 | **Getting Data from the Web:                   |
|       |           | www.AnnualReport.com**                         |
|       |           |                                                |
|       |           | In this session we will learn how to scrape    |
|       |           | websites if no API is provided. Specifically   |
|       |           | we will download PDF Annual Reports from       |
|       |           | www.AnnualReport.com.                          |
+-------+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
|       | Session 3 | **Getting Data from the Web: XBRL**            |

|       |           | In this session we will extract structured     |
|       |           | information from files that are tagged using   |
|       |           | eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL)  |
|       |           | framework.                                     |
+-------+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
|       | Session 4 | **Analyzing Data: XBRL Tags**                  |
|       |           |                                                |
|       |           | This session gives a small use case of the     |
|       |           | data encoded in XBRL files.                    |
+-------+-----------+------------------------------------------------+
|       | Session 5 | **Analyzing Data: Textual Analysis**           |
|       |           |                                                |
|       |           | In the last session of the day, we will do     |
|       |           | some simple analysis of words and phrases      |
|       |           | occurring in US and European financial         |
|       |           | statements.                                    |
