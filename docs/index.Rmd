# Introduction

Welcome to the practical application sessions of the **Mannheim Master in Management Analytics - Accounting Class 2023.** In the next days you will see how to solve common business applications with R and Excel and to dive deeper into some research related application.

The goal of those sessions is to give you a general overview of how common workflows can be automated using basic knowledge in HTML and Excel.

All sessions are programmed in R and a basic understanding of programming is needed. The code itself applies relatively advanced methods, hence it is not assumed that you follow each single logical step. Rather this part of the course is designed to give you a high level understanding of what is possible using common open-source languages such as R.
